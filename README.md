## üìä Usage

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### Run Dev Server

```bash
yarn serve
```

> Note: The local dev server can be accessed through port `8989` i.e., **`localhost:8989`** and corresponding components by accessing folder/file as **`localhost:8989/components/COMPONENT_FOLDER/index.html`** eg: `localhost:8989/components/alert/index.html`


### Build Components

```bash
yarn build
```



## üë©‚Äçüíª How it works

- Each component is present in its respective folder eg: `components/COMPONENT1`,`components/COMPONENT2`, Eg: `components/card` etc
- SCSS file is added and linked directly within HTML using `link` attribute which will be compiled by parcel which as default `tailwindcss` styles.

  ````HTML
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.scss">
  ````
  
  **Note: Tailwind Styles are required for each respective component style (SCSS) file within which you can use `@apply` directive to extract tw classes to respective component classes**
  ```scss
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;

  // Other styles here using @apply for extracting tailwind classes to each class
  ```
- Once the command `yarn build` is run, the output files will be present on `dist` folder with the same component structure.

## üñã Naming Convention

- Each Component should follow the naming as `SERIAL_NUMBER-COMPONENT_NAME`. Eg: `01-alert`,'02-notifications' etc
- When there is a variation of the component such as `alert` we can name as `01-alert-variant2` etc
- The serial number must follow along with category. For Example currently no card component is present, in that case `01-card`. Each component numbering starts from `01` followed by category

## ‚ûï How to add new component

1. Go to `src/components` directory. Duplicate the `template` folder into components with the component name. Follow [Naming Convention](#naming-convention) for naming the folder
2. Update the title in `index.html` and contents within `<!-- Component start --> <!-- Component End -->` lines.
3. Take a Screenshot of the result and replace the `preview.png` within the component folder.
4. Run `yarn serve` to play with changes
